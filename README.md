# My Simple Website

This is a basic 4-page website created using only **HTML** and **CSS**, without any frameworks or advanced tools.  
The website is completely **black and white**, keeping it clean and simple, just like a beginner's project.
I have created this website for one of my student to show her that how easy and free it is to public our portfolio website by using github pages. 
I hope she will take inspiration from this and will create her own digital foot prints on this humongous internet.
